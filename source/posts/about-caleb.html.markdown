Hi, I'm Caleb. I do the programming and electronics for the team, along with Cody. This fall I will be a Sophomore at Franklin High School with all of my teammates.

We program our robots in [Java](https://java.com/en/download/whatis_java.jsp), although we are looking to try out [Python](https://www.python.org/) (via [RobotPy](https://robotpy.github.io/)) this summer as an alternative.
